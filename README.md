# Your Weather App

## Overview

The app allows a user to enter a city and get up to date weather for that place using the longitude and latitude. The app was built using Vite with React and is written in Typescript, with Tailwind CSS used for styling.
The app uses geocode.maps to get the coordinates and the openweather api to get the weather data.
